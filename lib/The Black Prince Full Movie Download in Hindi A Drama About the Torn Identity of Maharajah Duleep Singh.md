However, others criticized the film for its slow pace, lack of emotional depth, and poor editing. Chris Knight of National Post wrote: "The Black Prince is a beautifully photographed film and an interesting historical tale from the murky depths of mid-19th-century British-Indian relations. But it suffers from a lack of narrative drive and a surfeit of expository dialogue." [^3^]
