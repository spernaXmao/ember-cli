# KMSpico 12.1.9 FINAL Portable: A Free Tool to Activate Windows and Office
 
If you are looking for a way to activate Windows and Office without paying for a license, you might have heard of KMSpico. KMSpico is a free tool that can activate various versions of Windows and Office, including the latest ones. In this article, we will explain what KMSpico is, how it works, and how to use it.
 
## What is KMSpico?
 
KMSpico is a software that mimics the activation process of Microsoft's Key Management Service (KMS). KMS is a system that allows large organizations to activate multiple copies of Windows and Office with a single server. KMSpico emulates this server on your computer and tricks Windows and Office into thinking that they are activated by KMS.

## How does KMSpico work?
 
KMSpico works by replacing the original files of Windows and Office with modified ones. These files contain a code that bypasses the activation check and makes Windows and Office think that they are activated by KMS. KMSpico also creates a scheduled task that runs every 180 days to renew the activation status.
