# Homeworld: Cataclysm - A Stand-Alone Game That Expands The Homeworld Universe
 
Homeworld: Cataclysm is a real-time strategy game that was released in 2000 as a stand-alone game, not an expansion of the original Homeworld. It was developed by Barking Dog Studios and published by Sierra Studios. The game features a new story, new factions, new ships, new gameplay mechanics and new graphics. It is also known as Homeworld: Emergence on GOG.com, due to trademark issues with Blizzard Entertainment.
 
In this article, we will review Homeworld: Cataclysm and see what makes it a worthy successor to the critically acclaimed Homeworld. We will also compare it to the remastered version of Homeworld that was released in 2015.

## Story
 
Homeworld: Cataclysm takes place 15 years after the events of Homeworld, where the Kushan reclaimed their ancient homeworld of Hiigara from the Taiidan Empire. The Kushan have re-established their clans and their council, but some clans have more power than others. The Mothership remains in orbit over Hiigara as a shipyard.
 
The game follows the adventures of Kiith Somtaaw, a minor mining clan that discovers a mysterious alien pod in an asteroid field. The pod contains a powerful and ancient lifeform that can infect and assimilate any technology it comes into contact with. The Somtaaw name it the Beast and try to contain it, but it escapes and starts spreading across the galaxy, threatening all lifeforms.
 
The Somtaaw must use their mining vessel, the Kuun-Lan, as their command ship and upgrade it with new modules and weapons to fight the Beast and its allies. They also encounter other factions, such as the Taiidan Republic, the Turanic Raiders, the Bentusi and the Progenitors. The game has 17 missions that span different locations and scenarios.

## Gameplay
 
Homeworld: Cataclysm uses the same engine as Homeworld, but introduces several changes and improvements to the gameplay. Some of these are:
 
- The ability to toggle time compression between normal speed and eight times faster.
- The ability to upgrade ships with new armor and abilities.
- The ability to add external modules to the command ship and carriers for research and fleet support.
- The elimination of fuel from the game.
- The ability to use the sensor display to issue attack orders to units.
- The ability to capture enemy vessels with resource collectors.
- The ability to harvest crystals that can be used for special abilities.
- The ability to transform some ships into different modes.

The game also introduces new 3D features such as moving parts and transforming ships. The game has a variety of ship types, such as fighters, corvettes, frigates, destroyers, cruisers and super capital ships. Each faction has its own unique ships and abilities. For example, the Somtaaw can use ramming frigates, mimics and dreadnoughts; the Beast can infect and assimilate enemy ships; the Progenitors can use ion cannons and hyperspace inhibitors.
 
The game has a multiplayer mode that supports up to eight players online or over LAN. The multiplayer mode includes player vs player or player vs CPU skirmishes with different maps and settings. The game also has a modding community that has created custom maps, models and campaigns for the game.
 
## Graphics
 
Homeworld: Cataclysm has improved graphics compared to Homeworld, with more detailed models, textures and effects. The game also has dynamic lighting and shadows, realistic physics and debris, and atmospheric effects such as nebulae and dust clouds. The game has a distinctive art style that blends sci-fi and fantasy elements. The game also has a cinematic camera that can zoom in and out of the action and create dramatic shots.
 
However, compared to the remastered version of Homeworld that was released in 2015, Homeworld: Cataclysm looks dated and pixelated. The remastered version has enhanced graphics with high-resolution textures, models and effects. It also has improved UI, sound and gameplay features. The remastered version includes both Homeworld and Homeworld 2 with updated graphics and compatibility
