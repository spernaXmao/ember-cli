## Installation
 
To install OneTweak, you will need the [Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)](https://skse.silverlock.org/), which is a tool that enhances the scripting capabilities of Skyrim. You can download SKSE from its official website and follow the instructions there to install it. After that, you can download OneTweak from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40706) and extract the contents of the archive to your Skyrim SE folder. You should see a folder called SKSE and a file called OneTweak.ini in your Skyrim SE directory.
 
## Configuration
 
OneTweak comes with a configuration file called OneTweak.ini, which you can edit with any text editor. Here, you can customize various settings for OneTweak, such as enabling or disabling borderless window mode, setting the window size and position, adjusting the process priority, and more. You can find a detailed description of each setting in the file itself. For example, if you want to enable borderless window mode, you can change the line that says "BorderlessWindow = 0" to "BorderlessWindow = 1". You can also set the resolution of the window by changing the values of "WindowWidth" and "WindowHeight". Save the file after making any changes.
 
## Usage
 
To use OneTweak, you need to launch Skyrim SE through SKSE. You can do this by running skse64\_loader.exe from your Skyrim SE folder or by using a mod manager that supports SKSE. Once you start the game, you should see a message in the top left corner that says "OneTweak loaded". If you enabled borderless window mode, you should also see that the game runs in a window without borders. You can alt-tab out of the game without encountering the double cursor bug. You can also check your task manager to see if OneTweak has changed the process priority of Skyrim SE.
 
## Conclusion
 
OneTweak is a simple but useful mod that improves the performance and convenience of Skyrim SE. It allows you to run the game in borderless window mode, fix the alt-tab issue, adjust the process priority, and more. It is compatible with most Bethesda games on the Gamebryo engine and requires SKSE to work. You can download it from Nexus Mods and configure it with a text editor. We hope this article has helped you install and use OneTweak for Skyrim SE.

## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any problems with OneTweak, you can try the following steps to fix them:
 
- Make sure you have the latest version of SKSE and OneTweak installed.
- Make sure you have the correct version of OneTweak for your game. There are different versions for Skyrim, Skyrim Special Edition, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Oblivion.
- Make sure you have edited the OneTweak.ini file correctly and saved it.
- Make sure you are launching the game through SKSE and not the default launcher.
- Make sure you have no other mods that conflict with OneTweak. You can use a mod manager like [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) or [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) to check for mod conflicts and load order issues.
