Fortunately, there is a way to download ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst for free without violating any laws or terms of service. You can use the ESRI Conservation Program (ECP), which provides free software and data to non-profit organizations and individuals working in conservation, education, research, and humanitarian fields. The ECP offers ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst as part of its legacy software collection.
 
To download ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst for free from the ECP, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the [ECP website](https://www.conservationgis.org/ecp/) and register for an account.
2. Log in to your account and go to the [legacy software page](https://www.conservationgis.org/ecp/software/legacy/).
3. Scroll down to the ArcView 3.x section and click on the link for ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst.
4. Download the zip file and extract it to your desired location.
5. Run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions to install ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst.
6. Enjoy using ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst for free!

Note that ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst is an old software that may not be compatible with newer operating systems or hardware. You may need to use a virtual machine or an emulator to run it on your computer. Also, you should only use ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst for non-commercial purposes and respect the ECP's terms of use.
  
ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst has many features and functions that can help you with your spatial analysis and modeling needs. Some of the main features are:

- Raster Calculator: This tool allows you to perform mathematical and logical operations on raster data, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logarithm, trigonometry, and more. You can also use conditional statements and functions to create new raster data based on existing data.
- Map Algebra: This tool allows you to perform spatial operations on raster data, such as overlay, buffer, clip, intersect, union, dissolve, and more. You can also use operators and functions to create new raster data based on spatial relationships.
- Surface Analysis: This tool allows you to perform analysis on elevation data, such as slope, aspect, hillshade, contour, viewshed, and more. You can also create new elevation data from other raster data using interpolation methods.
- Vector Analysis: This tool allows you to perform analysis on vector data, such as distance, direction, proximity, density, and more. You can also create new vector data from raster data using conversion methods.
- Model Builder: This tool allows you to create and run models that automate your spatial analysis and modeling workflows. You can use graphical elements to represent data sources, tools, parameters, and outputs. You can also save and share your models with others.

ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst is a versatile and powerful tool that can help you with many spatial analysis and modeling tasks. However, it is not the only tool available for these purposes. There are newer and more advanced tools that offer more features and functions, such as ArcGIS Spatial Analyst or QGIS Raster Calculator. You may want to explore these options if you need more capabilities or compatibility with newer data formats and standards.
