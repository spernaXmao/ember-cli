## Who was John Bunyan?
 
John Bunyan was born in 1628 in Elstow, Bedfordshire, England. He came from a poor family and had little formal education. He served as a soldier in the English Civil War and later became a tinker, a maker and mender of metal pots and pans. He married twice and had six children.
 
Bunyan had a dramatic conversion experience when he was about 25 years old. He was deeply troubled by his sins and fears of hell. He read the Bible and other religious books and attended various churches. He finally found peace and assurance of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone. He joined a Baptist congregation and became a preacher and a writer.
 
Bunyan suffered persecution for his faith and his preaching. He was arrested several times and spent 12 years in prison, where he wrote most of his books, including The Pilgrim's Progress. He was released in 1672 after the Declaration of Indulgence, which granted some religious freedom to nonconformists. He continued to preach and write until his death in 1688 from a fever.
 
Bunyan was a prolific and popular writer. He wrote about 60 books, mostly on religious topics, such as doctrine, devotion, biography, controversy, and allegory. His style was simple, vivid, and powerful. He used everyday language, biblical references, and illustrations from his own experience and imagination. His books have been widely read and admired by Christians of all denominations and backgrounds.
  
## What is an allegory?
 
An allegory is a literary device that uses characters, events, places, or objects to represent abstract ideas or principles. It is a way of conveying a moral or spiritual message through a story or a metaphor. An allegory usually has two levels of meaning: the literal or surface level, which tells the story; and the symbolic or deeper level, which reveals the hidden meaning.
 
Allegories are common in literature, especially in ancient and medieval times. Some examples of famous allegories are Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Dante's Divine Comedy, Spenser's The Faerie Queene, Orwell's Animal Farm, and Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia.
 
John Bunyan was a master of allegory. He used it to express his theological views and to illustrate the Christian life. His most famous allegory is The Pilgrim's Progress, which tells the story of Christian, a pilgrim who journeys from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City. Along the way, he faces many dangers, temptations, and enemies. He also meets many friends and helpers who guide him and encourage him.
 
La Guerra Santa is another allegory by Bunyan. It tells the story of Mansoul, a city that represents the human soul. It shows how Mansoul was created by Emmanuel (Jesus Christ), how it fell into sin and rebellion under Diabolus (Satan), how it was redeemed by Emmanuel's grace and power, and how it was sanctified by Emmanuel's Spirit and Word.
