## What are Lal Kitab Remedies?
 
Lal Kitab remedies are simple and easy to perform actions that aim to balance the negative effects of the planets in your horoscope. They are based on the principle of "like cures like", which means that you can attract positive vibrations by doing similar things as the planets. For example, if you have a weak Sun in your chart, you can strengthen it by wearing gold, donating wheat, or respecting your father.
 
Lal Kitab remedies are also known as "tona totka" or "upay", which means solutions or measures. They are different from the traditional Vedic remedies, which involve mantras, yantras, gemstones, or rituals.
