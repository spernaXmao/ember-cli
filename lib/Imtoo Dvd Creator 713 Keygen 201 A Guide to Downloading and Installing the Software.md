# MetaSynth 5 ED: A Powerful Tool for Sound Design and Synthesis
  
If you are looking for a software that can help you create amazing sounds and music, you might want to check out MetaSynth 5 ED. MetaSynth 5 ED is a sound design and synthesis software that lets you manipulate audio in various ways, such as painting, filtering, morphing, granulating, sequencing, and more. MetaSynth 5 ED is the educational version of MetaSynth 5, which means it has the same features but at a lower price.
  
MetaSynth 5 ED is not a conventional synthesizer or sampler. It does not use MIDI or any other musical notation system. Instead, it uses images to represent sound. You can paint your own sounds using different colors and shapes, or import any image or audio file and transform it into sound. You can also use MetaSynth 5 ED to analyze and resynthesize any sound, creating new timbres and textures.

MetaSynth 5 ED has six main modes: Image Synth, Image Filter, Spectrum Synth, Montage Room, Effects Room, and Sequence Room. Each mode has its own unique interface and functionality. You can switch between modes easily and combine them in creative ways. For example, you can use the Image Synth to create a sound from scratch, then use the Image Filter to apply effects to it, then use the Spectrum Synth to modify its frequency spectrum, then use the Montage Room to layer it with other sounds, then use the Effects Room to add more processing, and finally use the Sequence Room to arrange it into a musical composition.
  
MetaSynth 5 ED is compatible with Mac OS X 10.6 or later. It supports AIFF, WAV, SDII, MP3, and AAC audio formats. It also supports AU and VST plug-ins for further sound processing. MetaSynth 5 ED can export audio files up to 24-bit/96 kHz resolution.
  
MetaSynth 5 ED is a powerful tool for sound design and synthesis that can unleash your sonic creativity. Whether you are a musician, composer, producer, sound designer, or just curious about sound, you will find MetaSynth 5 ED to be an inspiring and fun software to work with. You can download a free demo version of MetaSynth 5 ED from the official website and try it out for yourself.

In this article, we will explore some of the features and functions of MetaSynth 5 ED in more detail. We will also provide some tips and tricks on how to use MetaSynth 5 ED effectively and creatively.
  
## Image Synth
  
The Image Synth is the core of MetaSynth 5 ED. It allows you to create sounds by painting images. The horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents pitch. The color and brightness of each pixel determine the amplitude and timbre of the sound. You can use different tools, such as brushes, shapes, gradients, text, and stamps, to paint your sounds. You can also import any image or audio file and convert it into sound.
  
The Image Synth has several parameters that you can adjust to fine-tune your sounds. For example, you can change the scale, tuning, tempo, resolution, envelope, and filter of your sounds. You can also apply various effects, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, distortion, and more. You can preview your sounds in real-time or render them to disk.
  
The Image Synth is a great way to experiment with sound synthesis and design. You can create complex and rich sounds with simple gestures. You can also explore the visual and sonic relationships between different images and sounds. For example, you can see how different shapes and colors affect the sound quality and character. You can also see how different sounds look like in the image domain.
  
## Image Filter
  
The Image Filter is a mode that lets you apply filters and effects to your images and sounds. You can use the Image Filter to enhance or modify your sounds in various ways. For example, you can use the Image Filter to add noise, blur, sharpen, invert, contrast, brightness, hue, saturation, or colorize your sounds. You can also use the Image Filter to apply more advanced effects, such as convolution, morphing, warping, fractalizing, or kaleidoscoping your sounds.
  
The Image Filter has a simple and intuitive interface. You can select from a list of filters and effects on the left side of the screen. You can adjust the parameters of each filter or effect on the right side of the screen. You can preview your sounds in real-time or render them to disk.
  
The Image Filter is a useful tool for adding variety and interest to your sounds. You can use the Image Filter to create subtle or dramatic changes to your sounds. You can also use the Image Filter to create new sounds from existing ones. For example, you can use the Image Filter to morph two sounds together or create fractal patterns from a single sound.
