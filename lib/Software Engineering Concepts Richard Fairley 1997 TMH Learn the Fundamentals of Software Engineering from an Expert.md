The book covers some of the most important topics in software engineering, such as:
 
- Planning a software project: This topic covers the activities and techniques for defining the scope, objectives, schedule, budget, and resources of a software project. It also discusses how to identify and manage risks, stakeholders, and quality factors.
- Software design: This topic covers the principles and methods for designing software systems that meet the requirements and specifications. It introduces various design notations, such as data flow diagrams, structure charts, state transition diagrams, and object-oriented diagrams. It also discusses how to evaluate and document software designs.
- Implementation issues: This topic covers the aspects and challenges of implementing software systems using programming languages and tools. It discusses how to select and use appropriate data structures, algorithms, control structures, exception handling mechanisms, and modularization techniques. It also covers how to apply coding standards, style guidelines, and documentation practices.
- Software testing: This topic covers the techniques and strategies for verifying and validating software systems. It introduces various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and regression testing. It also discusses how to design test cases, perform test execution, analyze test results, and report test findings.

The book also provides guidance on how to manage software projects effectively using various tools and techniques, such as configuration management, change control, version control, project tracking, team coordination, communication, and reporting. The book also introduces some of the emerging trends and issues in software engineering, such as agile methods, software reuse, software metrics, software quality models, software process improvement, and software engineering ethics.
