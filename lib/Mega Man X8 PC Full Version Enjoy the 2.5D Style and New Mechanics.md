If you want to experience this game on your PC, you can download it from several sources online. However, you should be careful about the legality and safety of the files you download, as some of them may contain viruses or malware. To avoid any risks, you can follow these steps to download and play Mega Man X8 on PC:
 
1. Go to [this link](https://archive.org/details/mega-man-x8-megaman-x8-rockman-x8), which is an archive of the original game disc[^4^]. Click on the "Download Options" button and choose "ISO Image". This will download a file named "mega-man-x8-megaman-x8-rockman-x8.iso", which is about 1.2 GB in size.
2. Download and install a program that can mount ISO files, such as [DAEMON Tools Lite](https://www.daemon-tools.cc/products/dtLite) or [WinISO](https://www.winiso.com/products/winiso-free.html). These programs allow you to create virtual drives that can read ISO files as if they were real discs.
3. Open the program you installed and create a new virtual drive. Then, right-click on the virtual drive icon and choose "Mount Image". Browse to the location where you saved the ISO file and select it. This will make the virtual drive act as if it had the game disc inserted.
4. Open the virtual drive and run the "setup.exe" file. This will launch the game installer. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the game on your PC. You may need to enter a serial number, which you can find in the "serial.txt" file inside the ISO file.
5. Once the installation is complete, you can run the game from the Start menu or from the desktop shortcut. You may need to adjust some settings, such as resolution, sound, and controls, to suit your preferences. You can also use a gamepad or a keyboard to play.
