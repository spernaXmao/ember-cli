If you do not have a license or activation key, you may be tempted to use a crack key to activate MATLAB R2012b. A crack key is a code that bypasses the license verification process and allows you to use MATLAB without paying for it. However, using a crack key is illegal and risky. It may expose your computer to malware, viruses, or spyware. It may also cause MATLAB to malfunction or crash. Moreover, it may violate the terms of use of MATLAB and result in legal consequences.
 
Therefore, we strongly advise you not to use a crack key to activate MATLAB R2012b. Instead, you should purchase a legitimate license and activation key from MathWorks or an authorized reseller. This way, you can enjoy the full benefits of MATLAB R2012b without compromising your security or integrity. You can also get technical support, updates, and access to online resources from MathWorks.
 
To activate MATLAB R2012b with a valid license and activation key, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install MATLAB R2012b from the MathWorks website or from a DVD.
2. Launch MATLAB R2012b and select "Activate MATLAB" from the Help menu.
3. Enter your MathWorks account information or create a new account if you do not have one.
4. Select the license that you want to activate and click "Next".
5. Enter the activation key that you received from MathWorks or an authorized reseller and click "Next".
6. Confirm your activation information and click "Finish".
7. Restart MATLAB R2012b and enjoy using it.

If you have any questions or issues regarding the activation process, you can contact MathWorks Support or visit their website for more information.
  
Why should you use MATLAB R2012b? MATLAB R2012b is a versatile and powerful software that can help you solve complex problems, explore data, and create stunning visualizations. It also offers many features and tools that can enhance your productivity and creativity. Some of the highlights of MATLAB R2012b are:

- The Toolstrip interface, which organizes MATLAB functionality in a series of tabs and sections that are easy to access and use.
- The Apps tab, which displays a gallery of MATLAB apps that you can use to perform common tasks and workflows without writing code.
- The Plots tab, which displays a gallery of plots available in MATLAB and any toolboxes that you have installed. You can create plots from the gallery by selecting the variables in the workspace and the type of visualization you want to use.
- The redesigned documentation, which provides comprehensive and up-to-date information on MATLAB features and functions. You can access the documentation from the Help menu or from the Help browser.
- The new unit testing framework, which enables you to write, run, and debug tests for your MATLAB code. You can also use the Test Browser app to view test results and generate test reports.
- The simplified MEX setup, which makes it easier to compile C/C++ or Fortran code into MEX files that can be called from MATLAB. You can also use the mex command with the -setup option to select a compiler.
- The new datetime and duration types, which enable you to work with dates and times in a convenient and intuitive way. You can also convert between MATLAB datetime and duration types and the corresponding types in Python and NumPy.

These are just some of the features and tools that MATLAB R2012b offers. To learn more about MATLAB R2012b, you can visit the MathWorks website or watch the video below.
