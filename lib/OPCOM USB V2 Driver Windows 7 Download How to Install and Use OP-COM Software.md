1. Download the OPCOM software from [http://op-com.hu/Downloads\_EN.aspx](http://op-com.hu/Downloads_EN.aspx). The USB drivers are included in the installation package. Choose the version that matches your device and Windows system. For example, if you have an OPCOM Professional device and a 64-bit Windows 7 system, download the OP-COM Professional software for x64.
2. Run the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install the OPCOM software on your computer. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.
3. Connect your OPCOM device to your computer via a USB cable. Windows should detect the device and install the driver automatically. You can check the device status in Device Manager. It should be listed under Universal Serial Bus controllers as OPCOM USB V2 Interface.
4. If Windows does not install the driver automatically, you can manually update it. Go to Device Manager and right-click on the OPCOM device. Select Update Driver Software and then Browse my computer for driver software. Navigate to the folder where you installed the OPCOM software and select the Drivers subfolder. Click Next and wait for Windows to install the driver.
5. Once the driver is installed, you can launch the OPCOM software from your desktop or Start menu. You should see a green dot next to the OPCOM icon in the lower right corner of the software window, indicating that the device is connected and ready to use.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the OPCOM USB V2 driver for Windows 7. You can now use OPCOM to diagnose and program your Opel/Vauxhall cars.

If you encounter any problems with the OPCOM USB V2 driver or the OPCOM software, you can try the following troubleshooting tips:

- Make sure you have the latest version of the OPCOM software and the driver. You can check for updates on the OPCOM website or in the software settings.
- Make sure you have a stable and reliable USB connection. Avoid using USB hubs or extension cables. Try a different USB port or cable if possible.
