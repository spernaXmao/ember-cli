The Leagoo S11 is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers decent performance, a large display, and a dual rear camera. However, it also has some drawbacks that you should consider before buying it. Here are some of the pros and cons of the Leagoo S11.
 
### Pros

- The Leagoo S11 has a 6.3-inch IPS display with a waterdrop notch and a 19:9 aspect ratio. The display is bright and contrasty, and offers a good viewing experience for watching videos, browsing the web, and playing games.
- The Leagoo S11 is powered by the MediaTek Helio P22 processor, which is an energy-efficient octa-core chipset with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. The phone can handle most daily tasks smoothly, and can run some demanding games at low settings. The storage can also be expanded with a microSD card.
- The Leagoo S11 has a dual rear camera setup with a 13 MP main sensor and a 2 MP depth sensor. The camera can take decent photos in daylight, with good colors and details. The depth sensor also helps to create a bokeh effect for portrait shots. The front-facing camera is an 8 MP sensor that can take good selfies and support face unlock.
- The Leagoo S11 has a 3300 mAh battery that can last for a day of moderate use. The phone also supports fast charging, which can charge the battery from 0% to 50% in about 30 minutes.
- The Leagoo S11 runs on Android 9 Pie, which is a relatively recent and stable version of the operating system. The phone has a minimalistic user interface, with some useful features like gesture navigation, split-screen mode, and smart assistant.
- The Leagoo S11 supports 4G LTE connectivity, which can provide fast and reliable internet access. The phone also supports dual SIM cards, OTG, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and FM radio.

### Cons

- The Leagoo S11 has a plastic body that does not feel very premium or durable. The phone also has thick bezels around the screen, which make it look outdated compared to other phones with full-screen designs.
- The Leagoo S11 has a low-resolution display of 1520x720 pixels, which makes the picture look pixelated and blurry. The display also has poor viewing angles and low sunlight legibility.
- The Leagoo S11 has a mediocre camera performance in low-light conditions. The photos tend to be noisy, grainy, and blurry. The camera also lacks some features like HDR, panorama, night mode, and video stabilization.
- The Leagoo S11 does not have NFC, wireless charging, or water resistance. These are some of the features that are common in many mid-range and high-end phones nowadays.
- The Leagoo S11 does not have any official warranty or after-sales service outside China. This means that if you encounter any problem with the phone, you may have to deal with the seller or the manufacturer directly, which can be time-consuming and costly.
