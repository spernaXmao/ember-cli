Garfield: The Movie is not the only film adaptation of the comic strip. In 2006, a sequel called Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties was released, which follows Garfield and Odie as they travel to London and meet a look-alike cat named Prince. The sequel also stars Breckin Meyer, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Bill Murray, along with Billy Connolly as Lord Dargis, the villain who wants to inherit Prince's estate. The sequel received even worse reviews than the first movie, but still managed to earn $141 million at the box office.
 
In 2024, a new animated feature film based on Garfield is scheduled to be released by 20th Century Studios and Alcon Entertainment. The film will be directed by Mark Dindal, who previously directed The Emperor's New Groove and Chicken Little. The film will feature the voices of Nicholas Hoult as Garfield, Chris Pratt as Jon Arbuckle and Hannah Waddingham as Dr. Liz Wilson. The film will be a reboot of the franchise and will focus on Garfield's origin story and how he met Jon and Odie. The film is expected to be more faithful to the comic strip than the previous live-action films.
 
Whether you prefer the live-action or the animated version of Garfield, you can find them online in Tamil dubbed versions. Just follow the tips we gave you earlier and enjoy watching your favorite cat on the screen. And remember, don't let Garfield's laziness rub off on you!
