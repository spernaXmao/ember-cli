## Automatic Mode
 
To use Automatic Mode, you need to insert Auto-Tune as a plug-in on your vocal track in your DAW (digital audio workstation). Then, you need to select the key and scale of your song from the drop-down menus. You can also use the Auto-Key plug-in to automatically detect the key and scale of your song.
 
Next, you need to adjust the Retune Speed knob, which controls how fast Auto-Tune corrects the pitch of your vocals. A lower value means more natural and subtle correction, while a higher value means more robotic and noticeable correction. You can also use the Humanize knob to add some variation and realism to the pitch correction.
 
If you want to create some vocal effects, such as the famous "Auto-Tune sound" or some harmonies, you can use the Flex-Tune and Formant knobs. Flex-Tune allows you to preserve some of the natural pitch variation of your vocals, while Formant allows you to change the tonal quality of your vocals. You can also use the Throat Length knob to adjust the size of your vocal tract.
 
Finally, you can use the Transpose and Timing knobs to change the overall pitch and timing of your vocals. Transpose lets you shift the pitch up or down by semitones, while Timing lets you move the vocals forward or backward in time.
 
## Graphical Mode
 
To use Graphical Mode, you need to first capture the pitch data of your vocals by clicking on the Track Pitch button and playing back your vocal track. Then, you need to switch to Graphical Mode by clicking on the Graph button.
