## What is Kalzium?
 
Kalzium is a software that was originally developed as part of the KDE education project, which aims to provide high-quality educational applications for different subjects and levels. Kalzium is one of the most popular and comprehensive chemistry applications in the project, and it has been translated into more than 40 languages.
 
Kalzium can help you explore the Periodic Table of Elements in various ways. You can view the elements by different categories, such as blocks, groups, periods, states, or properties. You can also use the year simulator to see how the table evolved over time, or the temperature simulator to see how the elements change their states at different temperatures. You can also search for information about any element, such as its name, symbol, atomic number, mass, electron configuration, ionization energy, melting point, boiling point, density, and more.
